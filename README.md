# Measles Outbreaks & Vaccination Rates Around The World

With the current uptick in Measles outbreaks in the world, my team and I decided to look at the measles cases around the world and how the United States compares to the rest of the world.

Here we looked at several data sets including World Bank, the World Health Organization, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Using the seperate data sets, my team and I merged some of these data sets together to answer the questions we asked.

## Reported Measles Cases By Country Wealth Classification

Here is a bar graph comparing the number of measles outbreaks over the years for different countries included in their respective wealth classification. And the table is also included to show the data in numbers.
